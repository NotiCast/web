        <p>
          When you receive your NotiCast device, it should already have the
          software installed. If the device provider has not already provided
          you with a flash drive containing your authentication credentials,
          or if you lose this flash drive, you will need to set up a new drive.
          Assuming you have requested and received credentials from the
          provider, you can follow the steps below to set up a new flash drive.

          <li>Plug in the flash drive and ensure that the filesystem is fat32</li>

              to change filesystem.

            <li>On MacOS, you can use the "Disk Utility" program to erase and format.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Move the credentials files from the zipped folder to the flashdrive.</li>
          <li>Boot up your system, and nag at Ryan to make sure it works</li>
