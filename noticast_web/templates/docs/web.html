  <h1>The NotiCast Website</h1>
  <p>
    This is a somewhat informal documentation coming from the main author of
    the website, Ryan. I'll be discussing some things about the core of the
    website and how development of the website takes place. First and foremost,
    the website runs perfectly both without jQuery and without JavaScript in
    general. This is to improve performance and to get rid of issues such as
    the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESWR4Tzx-Pk" target="_blank">
      dynamically loading refrigerator</a>. This is a practical problem for
    many websites, so despite the fact I'm using a client-side rendering
    library, the first render of content *must* be on the server.
  </p>
  <h3 class="subtitle">The Backend</h3>
  <p>
    NotiCast runs on a custom data-driven framework atop Flask, called the App
    Route Framework. This was designed to allow for easy integration with JSON
    APIs and ensures that each part of the design is separated into either a
    view (as an HTML template or JSON), a model (the database tables), and
    sometimes a controller.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each route is defined using a custom MethodView extension from Flask known
    as <code>AppRouteView</code>. Your route, when defined, should provide the
    following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>decorators[]:</strong> List of function decorators, such as
      <code>auth.login_required</code> or a Gigaspoon validation rule</li>
    <li><strong>template_name:</strong> String value, name of the Jinja2 HTML
      template that will be populated with the <code>populate</code> info</li>
    <li><strong>route:</strong> Name of the route the view will be registered
      as; used after a POST (doesn't work with <code>redirect_to</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>redirect_to:</strong> Name of the route the view will redirect
      to after a POST (doesn't work with <code>route</code>)</li>
    <li>
      <strong>populate(self, ...):</strong> Get all the data from database
      models which will then be used on the template; positional arguments
      from <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.14/routing/"
        target="_blank">werkzeug routing rules</a></li>
    <li>
      <strong>handle_post(self, values):</strong> Take incoming values from a
      request and handle them appropriately; should return a response from
      <code>app_view.response()</code></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="subtitle">The Frontend</h3>
  <p>
    For the frontend, I chose VueJS as the event handler. One day, it will
    integrate with Jinja2 for a hopefully seamless interaction, so the data can
    still be rendered server-side, but can also be updated client-side. There
    must be as little JavaScript interaction as possible; all things that
    interact with JavaScript must have a server-side or in-browser alternative.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "base.html" template that the HTML pages are based off of has some
    blocks that can be used for adding content. There's a <code>head</code>
    block for adding in dependencies and stylesheets, a <code>body</code> block
    which should contain the bulk of your application, and a
    <code>script</code> block, where you can put a &lt;script&gt; section. The
    <code>body</code> block is contained within a block with the id "app",
    which is then used by the default <code>script</code> block to set up VueJS
    with the default mixins - a method for <code>copy_target</code> and another
    for <code>close_target</code>, meaning some nonessential JavaScript
    enhancements are available out of the box by using the VueJS event system,
    similar to <code>@click="copy_target" data-target="#your-id"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, because of the layers of rendering on this website, it is
    not practical to look at an example. However, the templates themselves, and
    specifically <code>auth/register.html</code> are good examples of how to
    use Jinja2 and VueJS.
  </p>
  <h3 class="subtitle">Input Validation</h3>
  <p>
    While going through the code for the website, you have probably seen a
    variable similar to <code>g.username_validator</code>. This is a Gigaspoon
    validator. Using Gigaspoon validators makes it easy to validate on both
    the frontend and the backend, a set of requirements for a route. For
    example, the user registration route has a username validator. This lets
    the system generating the frontend have the same values that would be
    required on the backend. Similarly, on the same page, there is a validator
    for a set of radio buttons which can be iterated over for each button.
  </p>
  <p>
    When working on the backend for the application, each app view has a list
    of values called the `decorators`. These are applied to every incoming
    request, meaning we can stack all our validation options there. As an
    example, one of the simplest validators is checking how long a string is:
    <code>gs.validator(gs.v.Length("option_name", min=8))</code>. You can add
    that to your decorators, and now you have a value which will be validated
    on POST requests. You can then use the value inside Jinja2 templates by
    accessing <code>g.option_name_validator.min</code>, which is automatically
    populated on requests.
  </p>
